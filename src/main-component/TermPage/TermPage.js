                                    <h2>Reasons for Using Website Terms and Conditions</h2>
                                    <p>When you are planning to create a website, it’s very easy to overlook creating and adding a website terms and conditions template. This is because when you are browsing through sites, you may not look at this part unless you really have to – and even then, you might not actually read all the content! However, it’s very important to have the terms page on your website, for a number of reasons. Once you’ve learned all about these reasons, you may realize that adding this part to your website is really essential.</p>
                                    <p>Even a short terms and conditions agreement should include several key clauses to safeguard your business. For example, if you’re selling online and incorrectly price an item, your terms and conditions are what will enable you to cancel the order.</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Acceptable use of your website and all of its content.</li>
                                        <li>Rules on uploading any content in your website.</li>
                                        <li>Any and all websites which are linked to your own.</li>
                                        <li>The availability of your website.</li>
                                        <li>Returns and Guarantees for Customers</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>If any estimates of how long it will take the cleaning operatives to complete the job are being provided those are only estimates based on the average time it takes to clean a home or an office of similar size to the Client’s, it being difficult to calculate precisely how long such tasks may take and that a degree of flexibility may be required. Please note that one off cleans may take longer to complete due to longer intervals between cleaning sessions, number and type of cleaning tasks required, when compared to the regular maintenance cleaning of the same property.</p>
